## About
### Source code for **Phantom ServerSide** GUI

#### Phantom was a server-side made back in 2018 *(Formally known as "BruhK3K" at the time)*.
It has since been discontinued, and I decided to release the source code to the GUI.
Sometime in 2024 I began updating Phantom's GUI more regularly, and it's now become a sort of passion project.
#### Update *(May 14th, 2025)*:
Phantom Version 1.9.2 will most likely be the final version. *Bug Fixes Excluded*

#### Notice
Older version of Phantom may contain bugs that hinder the user experience. Please consider using the [newest version](./Phantom.rbxm).
