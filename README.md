## About
### Source code for **Phantom ServerSide** GUI

#### Phantom was a server-side made back in 2018 *(Formally known as "BruhK3K" at the time)*.
~~It has since been discontinued, and I decided to release the source code to the GUI.~~
Sometime in 2024 I began updating Phantom's GUI more regularly, and it's now become a sort of passion project.

#### Older versions may be broken or contain sloppy code.
Newer versions should work fine.
